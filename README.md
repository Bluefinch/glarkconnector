###Connector for the glark.io editor###

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bluefinch/glarkconnector.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Bluefinch/glarkconnector)

The glarkconnector is used to edit remote files with the [glark.io](https://github.com/Bluefinch/glark.io) editor.
Just fire a glarkconnector in a directory of your choice, go to your glark.io editor instance,
add the connector (the gear icon on the upper left corner) and the files in the directory will be available for remote editing!

The glarkconnector only needs Python without any dependency to run, so it can run almost anywhere.
Access to the files is secured by basic authentication.
